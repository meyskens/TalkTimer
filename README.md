TalkTimer
=========

TalkTimer is a project that helps by timing conference/meetup talks by offering a 2 part timer. You can see this as a timer screen that you can remote control and send messages to.  
It starts by creating a session, this session gives you a key and the ability to change the time. When you enter this key on a 2nd screen (for the presenter) it will show you the timer.  
TalkTimer counts down on the server side, so it will continue should the controller/client disconnect.
